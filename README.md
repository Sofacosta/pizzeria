## Project Description
This is my indepentent project to showcase the lesson learned last week: Object-Oriented JavaScript. This is a werbsite for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings and a size to order a pizza.      
## Specs
 
```
Describe: Pizza()
Test: "It will create Pizza instances with properties: toppings and size"
Expect(let pizza = new Pizza()).toEqual( {toppings: toppings, size: size});

Describe: Pizza.prototype.calculatePrice()
Test: "It will define a base price of $10 and calculate extra cost by adding selected toppings"
Expect(pizza.calculatePrice(["mushrooms", "pepperoni"])).toEqual( {toppings: toppings, size: size});
